 I am Teddy Anyanga, I enjoy working with ReactJs, JavaScript, NodeJS, and SQL. I have recently started helping start-up small businesses by creating WordPress websites for free. During my free time, I read tech and self-improvement books. I am currently on Optimal Handyman Website, a full-stack react application that will soon be hosted on Microsoft Azure.
