 I am Teddy Anyanga, I enjoy working with ReactJs, JavaScript, NodeJS, and SQL. I have recently started helping start-up sole trader businesses by creating websites for free. During my free time, I read tech and self-improvement books. I am currently on Optimal Handyman Website, a full-stack react application hosted on Microsoft Azure. You can check out the first version of the website here https://red-pebble-0b5920f00.5.azurestaticapps.net/
